####Type Name

A typename is the just the system name for the type and not a file system name. The name SHOULD NOT include an directory information or the .json suffix when used by the commands.

####Type Options

option       | meaning

namespace    | the namespace of the type

type       |       | the type associated with the property
required   | r     | property is required to have a value
multi      | r     | the property is multi valued (json array)

scale      | s     | how many decimal places should be kept
default    |       | the default value of the property if not set

All system scalara have a special character designation to make them easier to describe. Those designators are listed below.

###Remote Commands

Remote commands operate on types store on an service installation. These commands share many of the same options as the http commands.

####Usage

````
> rbc-types <cmd> <type-name> [env-options]
````

####Commands

command  | aliases | description
-------  | ------- | -----------
list     | ls      | list all the types on the remote system
get      | read    | print a remote type
fetch    | pull, download  | fetch a remote type and store locally
post     | push, upload    | install a remote type on the server
delete   | destroy | destroy the type on the system
listp    | lp      | list the properties of a remote

####Type Names

The typename is the just the name and not a partial url path. The user MUST assume that `/namespace/type/` will be prepended to the name prior to sending the request. Any initial slash will be tolerated but is not required. Any additional path elements will be appended to the `namespace/types/` prior to executing the request.

####Options

All remote commands require an environment. These options behave consistently with those in the  If none is specifed then the command will use the default. If no default is set then to command will fail.
