bodhi CLI tools
=============

Command Line Tools for the Bodhi Cloud

##Installation

The cli tools require a nodejs runtime and are installed using the node package manager (npm).

````
> npm install -g bodhi-cli
````

Not that on *nix based systems and Macs, a global install command MUST be run using sudo.

One the tools are installed, verify the installation using the version command. The command SHOULD respond with a semantic version of the tools: M is the major version, m is the minor version, and b is the build increment.

````
> bodhi -V
  M.m.b
````

## Getting Started

2. Create a directory for your workspace and `cd` into it.
3. `bodhi init` <br> This will create a rbc-project.json which will house all your environment info. It will
also create an /apps directory where your apps will reside.
4. `bodhi new [ENVIRONMENT NAME]` This will create a new environment entry in rbc-project.json.
5. Open up rbc-project.json and fill in information about your new environment. <br>
Example: <br>
```
{
     "environments": {
           "[ENVIRONMENT NAME]": {
               "uri": "[API ENDPOINT]",
               "user": "[USERNAME]",
               "password": "[PASSWORD]",
               "namespace": "[NAMESPACE]"
          }
     },
     "default": "[ENVIRONMENT NAME]"
}
```
Once you do this, all commands will be used under the default environment unless you specify otherwise with the -e flag.

##General Str

###Common Usage

````
<rbc-tool> [options] <command> [arguments ..]
````
The first entry is the name of the tool. The second argument is the command. All further arguments are interpretted in the context of the command.

Options can be specified anywhere on the command line __AFTER__ the tool designation. The following commands are considered equivalent.

````
bodhi -e my-environment -v command
````
````
bodhi -v command -e my-environment
````
````
bodhi command -v -e my-environment
````

###Processing Options

The following switch are universal and have consistent semantics across the tools.

long    | short | meaning
----    | ----- | -------
version | V     | request the version of a tool
help    | H     | request help in the form of usage instructions
verbose | v     | execute the command with intermediate output

###Commands

Local commands operate on JSON structures stored on the local filesystem.

rm-prop    |          | remove an existing property
gen-instance |      | generate a sample object based on the type

####Type Name

A typename is the just the system name for the type and not a file system name. The name SHOULD NOT include an directory information or the .json suffix when used by the commands.

####Type Options

option       | meaning
-----        | ----------
namespace    | the namespace of the type

####Property Options

option     | short | meaning
-----      | ____  | ----------
type       |       | the type associated with the property
required   | r     | property is required to have a value

scale      | s     | how many decimal places should be kept
default    |       | the default value of the property if not set

####Short Hand Types

All system scalara have a special character designation to make them easier to describe. Those designators are listed below.

###Remote Commands

Remote commands operate on types store on an service installation. These commands share many of the same options as the http commands.

####Usage

````
> rbc-types <cmd> <type-name> [env-options]
````

####Commands

command  | aliases | description
-------  | ------- | -----------
list     | ls      | list all the types on the remote system
get      | read    | print a remote type
fetch    | pull, download  | fetch a remote type and store locally
post     | push, upload    | install a remote type on the server
delete   | destroy | destroy the type on the system
listp    | lp      | list the properties of a remote

####Type Names

The typename is the just the name and not a partial url path. The user MUST assume that `/namespace/type/` will be prepended to the name prior to sending the request. Any initial slash will be tolerated but is not required. Any additional path elements will be appended to the `namespace/types/` prior to executing the request.

####Options

All remote commands require an environment. These options behave consistently with those in the  If none is specifed then the command will use the default. If no default is set then to command will fail.
