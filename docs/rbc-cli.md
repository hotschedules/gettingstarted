bodhi CLI tools
=============

Command Line Tools for the Bodhi Cloud

##Installation

The cli tools require a nodejs runtime and are installed using the node package manager (npm).

````
> npm install -g bodhi-cli
````

Not that on *nix based systems and Macs, a global install command MUST be run using sudo.

One the tools are installed, verify the installation using the version command. The command SHOULD respond with a semantic version of the tools: M is the major version, m is the minor version, and b is the build increment.

````
> bodhi -V
  M.m.b
````

## Getting Started

2. Create a directory for your workspace and `cd` into it.
3. `bodhi init` <br> This will create a rbc-project.json which will house all your environment info. It will
also create an /apps directory where your apps will reside.
4. `bodhi new [ENVIRONMENT NAME]` This will create a new environment entry in rbc-project.json.
5. Open up rbc-project.json and fill in information about your new environment. <br>
Example: <br>
```
{
     "environments": {
           "[ENVIRONMENT NAME]": {
               "uri": "[API ENDPOINT]",
               "user": "[USERNAME]",
               "password": "[PASSWORD]",
               "namespace": "[NAMESPACE]"
          }
     },
     "default": "[ENVIRONMENT NAME]"
}
```
Once you do this, all commands will be used under the default environment unless you specify otherwise with the -e flag.

##General Str

###Common Usage

````
<rbc-tool> [options] <command> [arguments ..]
````
The first entry is the name of the tool. The second argument is the command. All further arguments are interpretted in the context of the command.

Options can be specified anywhere on the command line __AFTER__ the tool designation. The following commands are considered equivalent.

````
bodhi -e my-environment -v command
````
````
bodhi -v command -e my-environment
````
````
bodhi command -v -e my-environment
````

###Processing Options

###Commands

Local commands operate on JSON structures stored on the local filesystem.

gen-instance |      | generate a sample object based on the type

####Type Name

A typename is the just the system name for the type and not a file system name. The name SHOULD NOT include an directory information or the .json suffix when used by the commands.

####Type Options

option       | meaning
-----        | ----------

###Remote Commands

Remote commands operate on types store on an service installation. These commands share many of the same options as the http commands.

####Usage

````
> rbc-types <cmd> <type-name> [env-options]
````

####Commands

command  | aliases | description
-------  | ------- | -----------
list     | ls      | list all the types on the remote system
get      | read    | print a remote type
fetch    | pull, download  | fetch a remote type and store locally
post     | push, upload    | install a remote type on the server
delete   | destroy | destroy the type on the system
listp    | lp      | list the properties of a remote

####Type Names

The typename is the just the name and not a partial url path. The user MUST assume that `/namespace/type/` will be prepended to the name prior to sending the request. Any initial slash will be tolerated but is not required. Any additional path elements will be appended to the `namespace/types/` prior to executing the request.

####Options

All remote commands require an environment. These options behave consistently with those in the  If none is specifed then the command will use the default. If no default is set then to command will fail.

app-tools
=========
app-tools is a command line tool, bundled with bodhi-cli, that allows app developers to quickly generate
an app and publish it to the cloud so that it can be viewed on the mobile container.

## Local Commands

### App Creation Commands

#### new-app

Creates a new app skeleton in /apps folder based on the type of skeleton app specified. 

Notes:

* App name must be unique to the namespace.
* The app's profile name is the same as the app name.
* Once app name and profile name has been specified, it cannot be changed.

##### Signature

```
> app-tools new-app <app-name> [meta-data-options] [env-options]
```

##### Arguments

1. app name

##### Options

See environment options above (environment options are only needed for app-generator).

Meta Data Options:

long        | short     | arg                                 | meaning
----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------
type        | t         | custom (default), app generator, angular   | specifies the type of skeleton project to create
model       | m         | resource type                       | specifies the resource type for the app generator function

##### Return

None.

##### Custom App

Creates a custom app skeleton in /apps/\<app-name\>.
The custom app skeleton just has the required files needed to publish the app.

```
> app-tools new-app <app-name> [meta-data-options]
```

##### Angular App

Creates an angular app skeleton in /apps/\<app-name\>.

```
> app-tools new-app <app-name> -t angular [meta-data-options]
```

##### App Generator

Creates a list-detail app based on the specified type (-m). The app will list the 20 most recent records fo the specified type. The user can then drill down and see the record in more detail. 

Notes:

* Environment information is used to grab the type definition remotely from the environment's namespace.
* The model with the select action (specified by the -m flag) will be added to the profile definition upon app creation.

```

```

### Profile Definition Commands
